<div class = "introduction"> 
<h1> <div class = "hello">  Hello! </div> </h1>
 <p> Welcome to RCR Go Veggie. We are Rose, Chloe and Rosette. We are not qualified chefs or nutritionalists but we just have a passion for food and want to share it! </p>
 <p>This blog is for those of you who may already be vegetarian but also those of you who may be looking to incorporate more vegetarian meals into your weekly roster. </p>
 <p> Cooking and sharing delicious food is what we love to do. We are all at different points with our journeys with vegetarianism, some of us are just starting and some of us have been vegetarian for a while. We all enjoy different types of food so there is something for everyone on this blog.  What joins us together is a passion for food. </p>
 <p>A study of 2,000 adults found 59% tend to cook the same dishes and rotate them throughout the week. We hope that through the recipes that we share, that you may find some inspiration to try cooking some new dishes! </p>

 <div class = "chloep"> <p> Hi I'm Chloe! I'm from Surrey but have lived in Leeds since 2018. I have a MA in Modern History and have been working in the third sector, specifically with the rough sleeping community, since 2020. I have been vegetarian on and off since 2014.  I love taking the time to cook new recipes with my partner but we have very different styles of cooking! I’m very ordered and like to follow recipes and my partner is a whirlwind in the kitchen. I think that cooking and food is a great way to bring people and communities together. </p>
